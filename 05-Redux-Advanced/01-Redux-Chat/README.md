# Redux chat

Today, we'll continue to tame Redux with a new challenge: building a **multi-channel messaging application**, just like Slack! Here is the wanted final result üëá

## 1. Setup

Once again, we will start from the [Redux boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/redux-boilerplate).

```bash
cd ~/code/<github_username>

# Download boilerplate to new project `chat-redux`
git clone git@github.com:lewagon/redux-boilerplate.git chat-redux
cd chat-redux

# Destroy existing boilerplate git history, and start a new one
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with boilerplate"

# Create a GitHub repo, and push!
hub create
git push origin master

# Install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file with:
yarn install

# Time to open Sublime Text and code.
stt
```

Launch a `webpack-dev-server` and open a browser at `http://localhost:8080`!

## 2. Components / Containers

Think about how you will split this app. **Take a paper and a pencil ‚úèÔ∏è**, and try to draw the components.

## 3. Redux state tree

Before diving into the code, let's thing about the **Redux state**. We need to:

1. Store a list of messages
1. Store a list of channels
1. Store the selected channel
1. Store the current username

Open your `src/index.jsx` and try to implement the relevant `initialState`:

```js
const initialState = {
  // TODO
};
```

üí° Before storing the username, you may need to [prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) the user!

## 4. Reducers

For every key in the state, create a reducer and add it to the `combineReducers()` call. Every reducer can start with the [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function) reducer:

```js
export default function(state = null, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

We will soon add action handling to some of them.

## 5. Redux middlewares

Now that you are familiar with Redux, know that in a real-life project, we always have to make AJAX calls. Also, we like to have actions logged in the console. That's why we'll always install these two middlewares:

- [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger)
- [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise)
