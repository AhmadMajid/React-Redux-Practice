To save time, in all lectures + exercises of this week, we will start from **boilerplates**. A boilerplate is a set of folder and files already configured so that you can start coding right away. Many boilerplates exist covering all combination of permutation in the (ES6, Babel, Webpack, etc.) set. At Le Wagon, we made our own: [webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/webpack-boilerplate)

The goal of this exercise is to, at once, start **from scratch** and see how the different pieces are glued together.

```bash
cd ~/code/<github_nickname>/react-redux-challenges
cd 01-Tooling/04-Webpack-From-Scratch
```

ðŸ’¡ Notice there were no `yarn install` as the folder does not contain any `package.json`

## Initializing a Node.JS project

The first thing you need is a `package.json` file. You can generate one with the following interactive command:

```bash
yarn init
```
